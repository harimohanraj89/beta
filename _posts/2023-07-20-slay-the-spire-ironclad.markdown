The Ironclad Ascension 20 run (without Heart) is complete! My biggest Ironclad learnings
after this series are:

* I'm no longer scared of exhausting too many cards. They can provide tons of block, and
  thin out your deck in a good way during combats. Second Wind and Fiend Fire are amazing!
* YOLO attack decks with no defense seldom work out.
* Snecko Eye and Runic Pyramid are incredible.

The ironclad run begins! This run featured a Snecko Eye with expensive attacks like
Bludgeon and Clothesline. Brimstone and Demon Form provided late game scaling, and
Reaper helped keep me alive.

{% capture ic_asc01_desc %}
This was my first time using Berserk, and Runic Pyramid made it easy to play at
the right time. The extra energy enabled Inflames and Demon Form to give me the
strength I needed.

{% capture ic_asc02_desc %}
Runic Pyramid, Power Through, and True Grit were a great combination for block.
I was able to take the Fusion Hammer and upgrade my cards with Armaments+ x2
instead. An early Ritual Dagger was the big attack that got me through most fights.

{% capture ic_asc03_desc %}
An Apotheosis from Neow gave me momentum at the start of this run. I tried my hand
at a "Rampage" deck some help from Headbutt and Warcry. The deck soon evolved into
a pretty standard deck with some strength from Inflame, some extra damage from
Charon's Ashes, and a Medkit to extinguish statuses.

{% capture ic_asc04_desc %}
A Searing Blow on floor 2 carried this run. The rest of the deck assembled support
offensively with Double Tap and Immolate, and defensively with some True Grit and
Power Through action. Reaper and some strength gain helped keep me alive too.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture ic_asc05_desc %}
This was my first successful run exploring the power of the Exhaust mechanic. Feel No Pain
provided a significant amount of block, paired with True Grit and Second Wind. Pocketwatch
helped me sail through Act 1. Sacred Bark and White Beast Statue were a great pair. The
Chemical X with Whirlwind, as well as Runic Pyramid, help me decisively end fights.

{% capture ic_asc06_desc %}
My first successful with the holy trinity of Corruption, Dark Embrace, and Feel No Pain!
Fiend Fire and Red Skull finished most hallway fights, and Juggernaut closed out longer
battles.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html
    character="Ironclad"

{% capture ic_asc07_desc %}
This run was shaped by an early Demon Form and Whirlwind from the Match and Keep event.
After obtaining them, the rest of the deck focused on block, and some minor strength gain
like an Inflame. Meat on the Bone provided a lot of healing after combats, and Runic
Pyramid after Act 2 sealed the deal.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture ic_asc08_desc %}
This run had a great set of relics to support it, including an early Molten Egg, Paper Phrog,
and Thread and Needle. Demon Form, tons of card draw, and Whirlwind finished most fights.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html
    character="Ironclad"

    completed="yes"

{% capture ic_asc09_desc %}
This was another fun run with Corruption, Dark Embrace, and Feel No Pain. Five Apparitions
with Toxic Egg and Runic Pyramid was a great way to stay alive long enough for Demon Form
to scale up.
{% endcapture %}

%}

{% capture ic_asc10_desc %}
Halfway there! I got a Snecko Eye boss relic swap, and loaded up on expensive tools like
Bludgeon, Clothesline, Impervious, and Fiend Fire. Barricade and Entrench provided some
much needed sustain.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html

%}

{% capture ic_asc11_desc %}
This was a straightforward run. Brutality let me skip an energy relic in Act 2 and pick up
the Cursed Bell. The deck featured balanced card draw with Pommel Strikes and Battle Trance,
energy generation with Bloodlettings, and strength scaling with Inflame and Rupture (which
worked great with the Bloodlettings).
{% endcapture %}

{% capture ic_asc12_desc %}
Another Searing Blow run! A thinner deck, Double Tap, and Headbutts helped me play Searing Blow
as often as possible, and Feel No Pain helped me survive the longer battles.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html
    character="Ironclad"
    ascension="12"

{% capture ic_asc13_desc %}
Another Snecko Eye boss swap. Perfected Strikes got me through Act 1. Demon Form
and Reaper provided the scaling and healing I needed for the late game.
{% endcapture %}

    character="Ironclad"
    ascension="13"
    completed="yes"
    file="/images/sts/sts-ic-a13.png"
    description=ic_asc13_desc
%}

{% capture ic_asc14_desc %}
This run was carried by great relics. Snecko Eye, Molten Egg, Pen Nib, a couple of boat
relics, even a Fossilized Helix. Demon Form provided scaling, Immolate provided area damage,
and Fiend Fire provided single-target damage to finish off bosses.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html

%}

{% capture ic_asc15_desc %}
I scraped through most of this run with Ritual Dagger, Demon Form, Reaper, and Immolate.
I sacrificed several upgrades to Rest instead. However, an Apotheosis and Lee's Waffle
in an Act 3 shop came in clutch to heal me up and provided those much needed upgrades.

{% capture ic_asc16_desc %}
Red Skull, Torii, and Feed worked well together to comfortable keep my life total below
50%. A Snecko Eye after Act 2 helped seal the deal on this victory.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture ic_asc17_desc %}
This run featured a lot of fun synergies. Black Blood, Blood Vial, and Lizard
Tail worked towards keeping me alive. White Beast Statue, Toy Ornithopter, and
Potion Belt as well. An upgraded Apotheosis helped turn this deck into a winner.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html
    character="Ironclad"
    ascension="17"

    description=ic_asc17_desc
%}

{% capture ic_asc18_desc %}
This may have been my first run with an Exhume. I learned that it was a great
tool to replay an Offering or Master of Strategy. Along with some Inflames and
a Demon Form, this led to some huge Whirlwind turns to end fights decisively.
{% endcapture %}

%}

{% capture ic_asc19_desc %}
A Fusion Hammer boss swap and a quick Armements gave me a lot of momentum to
start this run. Feel No Pain and Dark Embrace gave me survivability and card
draw. Some great relics like an early Toxic Egg, Gremlin Horn, Runic Pyramid,
and Paper Phrog cemented this victory.
{% endcapture %}
{% include sts_run.html

{% capture ic_asc20_desc %}
And finally, the Ascension 20 run. This run helped me truly understand the importance
of solving upcoming problems, instead of trying to build some sort of deck archetype.
With a wide selection of Rare cards, and a good balance of card draw and energy generation,
this deck got me to my first Ascension 20 win.
